# first_site o_O
First Site is my first web project that I created to learn the basics of web development. In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple but functional website. (Â¬â€¿Â¬)


The project is designed to demonstrate basic web development skills and serve as a foundation for future more complex projects. (* >Ï‰<)

ðŸ“¦ Description  Â¬_Â¬

My First Site is a website I developed from scratch to practice basic web development techniques. The project features simple structure, styling and interaction through JavaScript.

âœ¨ This project will be a great foundation for further improvements and adding new features! â—•_â—•
